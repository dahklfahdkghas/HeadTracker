Print `Main.stl` on its back, `Clip.stl` standing.

`Main.stl` has a hole above RGB LED (indicates Bluetooth connection state).  
Insert a piece of transparent fillament into it, for a light guide.

Glue a piece of little something on the case's reboot button (from inside or outside, your preference) to locate it easier.  
Board records orientation on boot, so rebooting is a way to reset orientation, no additional buttons needed.  
Note: Bluetooth connection will break on reboot just to restore quickly after.

Solder 2S balance plug to the board and press-fit it into case -- can power the board from FatShark's battery.  
There is a place for on/off switch, but that's optional.
